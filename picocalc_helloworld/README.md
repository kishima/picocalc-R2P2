# PicoCalc Hello World

Demonstrate how to use spi screen, i2c keyboard and psram on PicoCalc.

## Building
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/clockworkpi/PicoCalc.git
cd PicoCalc/Code/picocalc_helloworld/

mkdir build
cd build
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/where/pico-sdk/is
cmake ..
make  
```

## How to Upload UF2 

Uploading a UF2 file to the Raspberry Pi Pico on a Linux system is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Raspberry Pi Pico
Enter Bootloader Mode:

- Hold down the BOOTSEL button on your Pico.
- While holding the button, connect the Pico to your Linux PC via USB.
- Release the BOOTSEL button.
- Check If the Pico Is Recognized:

Your Pico should appear as a mass storage device named RPI-RP2.

Verify using the following command:

```bash
lsblk
```

You should see a new device (e.g., /media/$USER/RPI-RP2 or /run/media/$USER/RPI-RP2).

### Step 2: Copy the UF2 File to the Pico
```
cp your_firmware.uf2 /media/$USER/RPI-RP2/
```

### Step 3: Run it
On PicoCalc, the default serial port of the Pico is the USB Type-C port, not its built-in Micro USB port.  
So here is the standard running procedures: 

- Unplug the pico from Micro-USB cable
- Plug the pico via USB Type-C
- Press Power On on Top of the PicoCalc


If your firmware includes serial output, you can monitor it using **minicom** or **screen**:   
```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

(Replace /dev/ttyACM0 with the correct serial port for your Pico.)  

The serial monitor of **Arduino IDE** is another great choice for PicoCalc serial output on both Linux and Windows.
